<!-- How to create a react app  -->


Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run:


-- npx create-react-app app_name
-- cd my-app
-- npm start


git checkout -b আপনার নাম
